## 🚀 Major Release: Real-time AI Cost Protection

**AgentGuard v1.2.0** brings autonomous AI cost protection that actually works. Unlike monitoring tools, AgentGuard *prevents* runaway costs before they happen.

### 🔥 Key Features
- **Real-time budget enforcement** - Auto-kill protection before costs spiral
- **Zero code changes** - Just 2 lines to protect any AI agent
- **Comprehensive coverage** - Supports all major HTTP clients (fetch, axios, undici, got)
- **Live pricing updates** - No stale hard-coded prices
- **Graceful failure modes** - Catchable errors vs hard process kills
- **Multi-process support** - Redis-backed shared budgets

### 🎯 What's New in v1.2.0
- Real-time price fetching from community sources
- Enhanced HTTP interception (undici, got, http/https modules)
- Privacy-aware logging with data redaction
- Improved token counting for streaming and multimodal content
- Production-ready defaults with soft failure modes
- Comprehensive browser distribution builds

### 📊 Why AgentGuard?
While tools like tokencost, LangChain callbacks, and tokmon help you *measure* costs, AgentGuard is the only tool that *prevents* them with real-time autonomous protection.

**Download**: https://npmjs.com/package/agent-guard
